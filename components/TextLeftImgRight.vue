              Previously I worked as a full-time mechanical engineer in an M&E
              consultancy firm. At first, I thought I loved doing my job. As
              time goes by, I realize that I don't see myself wanting to
              continue working in this field in the future. I told myself is

              about it.

              After giving some thought to it, I decided to do something about
              it. At that moment, I came to remember that I was interested in
              coding when I was learning C programming during my first-year
              degree. From that onwards, My journey in coding begins.

              I started by self-learning Python following the guides from a
              book, titled "Learn Python 3 The Hard Way" by Zed A. Shaw. In the
              beginning, It started well. I learned Object-Oriented Programming
              and created a simple option choosing game. However, I notice that
              this will not take me far enough. I did some research afterward
              and found that web development suits my interest since I want to
              build personal projects.

              When I saw an advertisement from The Hacker Collective (THC)
              promoting their self-learning program for web development, the
              next thing that came to mind is let's try this and see how it
              goes. My coding journey continues. I was coding every day,
              sometimes late at night, and on weekends while still having my
              full-time job.

            >
              After six months, the co-founder from THC approached me. He asked
              whether I would be interested to take up an internship in their
              company. I accepted their offer and worked as a front-end web
              developer in

              Hi there! I'm a self-taught developer with a background in
              mechanical engineering (graduated from Multimedia University).
              After discovering my passion for web development, I made a career
              change and became a frontend web developer. Currently working as a
              Software Developer in

              complicated features.
